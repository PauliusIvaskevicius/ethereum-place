This website was created by @codemaxwell.

ETH Place replicates the behaviour of the famous /r/place concept.

This website uses ethereum smart contracts to store and manipulate data.

Frontend of this site was made with react and moralis.

This implementation supports canvas size of 100x100. Larger canvas size would require the use of WebGL for rendering and modified smart contract to support fetching of larger data structure.
